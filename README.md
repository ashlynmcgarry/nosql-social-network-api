# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description

This Social Network API allows a user to make a range of back end API calls for a Social Networ startup where users can share their thoughts, reacht to friend's thoughts and create a friends list. Utilising Express.js, MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM, it provides a full range of GET, PUT, POST and DELETE routes to add new data and update existing data. This project has allowed me to utilise a NoSQL database model as well as Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose to access and make requests to a database via Insomnia.
